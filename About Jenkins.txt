About Jenkins
Jenkins is an open‑source automation server used to automate building, testing, and deploying software as part of CI/CD pipelines. It integrates with tools like Git, Maven, Docker, and Kubernetes to run jobs automatically whenever code changes.[1][2][3][4]

## What Jenkins does

- Automates repetitive tasks such as compile, test, package, and deploy.[3][1]
- Works as a central CI/CD server that listens to code changes and triggers pipelines.[5][1]
- Supports hundreds of plugins to connect with SCMs (Git, GitHub), build tools (Maven, Gradle), and cloud platforms.[6][4]

## Step 1: Install Jenkins

- Ensure Java (11 or 17) is installed, then download Jenkins (war, package, or Docker image) from the official site.[4][7]
- Run Jenkins (for example, war file with `java -jar jenkins.war --httpPort=8080`) and open http://localhost:8080 to finish setup and unlock Jenkins.[4]

## Step 2: Basic configuration

- Install suggested plugins and create the first admin user during the setup wizard.[7][4]
- Configure global tools (JDK, Git, Maven/Gradle) under “Manage Jenkins → Global Tool Configuration”.[8][7]

## Step 3: Create a Freestyle job

- From the dashboard click “New Item → Freestyle project”, give a name, and save.[9][8]
- In the job, set:  
  - Source Code Management: Git repo URL and credentials.  
  - Build Triggers: e.g., Poll SCM or GitHub webhook.  
  - Build Steps: commands like Maven/Gradle or shell/batch scripts.[8]

## Step 4: Run and check builds

- Click “Build Now” to run; watch progress in “Build History” and open “Console Output” for logs.[9][8]
- Configure post‑build actions such as archiving artifacts, publishing test reports, or sending notifications (email, Slack, etc.).[8]

## Step 5: Jenkins Pipeline basics

- A pipeline is “CI/CD as code” written in a Jenkinsfile using declarative or scripted syntax.[10][4]
- Typical stages in a pipeline:  
  - Checkout: pull latest code from Git.  
  - Build: compile/package and produce artifacts.  
  - Test: run unit/integration tests.  
  - Deploy: push artifacts to servers, containers, or Kubernetes.[10][5]

## Step 6: Create a Pipeline job

- In Jenkins, click “New Item → Pipeline”, name it, and choose Pipeline type.[3][4]
- Under “Pipeline”, either:  
  - Paste pipeline script directly in the UI, or  
  - Point to a Jenkinsfile stored in the Git repository (recommended for real projects).[5][4]

## Step 7: Security and plugins

- Use “Manage Jenkins → Plugins” to install integrations like GitHub, Docker, Kubernetes, and notification plugins.[6][7]
- Configure security: users, roles, and credentials (SSH keys, tokens, passwords) under “Manage Jenkins → Security” and “Credentials”.[7][4]

If you want, the next step can be a very small Jenkinsfile example with build–test–deploy stages suitable for a Java or Node.js project.
